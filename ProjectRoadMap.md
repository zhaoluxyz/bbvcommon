The road map lists features that we want to include in the future.

  * **Bootstrapper** - simplifies application bootstrapping by providing a generic startup and shutdown pattern. The startup and shutdown mechanism is easily extendable by pluggable bootstrapping behaviors.

  * further support for **Silverlight** - note that EventBroker, StateMachine, AsyncModules are already available

  * further support for **Test Driven Development** - optimize components regarding testability

  * support for **symbol source** - simplify debugging of code using bbv.Common
